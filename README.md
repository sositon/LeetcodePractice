# LeetCode Practice Solutions

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode and NeetCode practice solutions! This repository serves as a personal space for me to track my progress, reflect on my learning journey, and share my solutions with others preparing for software engineering interviews. The primary goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills and understand various data structures and algorithms deeply.

## Introduction

The journey of preparing for coding interviews can be challenging and rewarding. Through this repository, I aim to tackle a curated list of problems from LeetCode and NeetCode, covering a wide range of topics essential for cracking technical interviews. This endeavor is not just about solving problems but about learning to approach problems efficiently and write clean, optimized code.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized by topics corresponding to common data structures and algorithms:
- **Arrays**
- **Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Trees**
- **Graphs**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **...and more**

Within each topic, you'll find folders for individual problems, each containing a `README.md` with the problem statement, my solution(s), and a detailed explanation of my thought process and the concepts involved.

## How to Navigate

- To explore solutions, simply navigate to the topic of interest and select a problem.
- Each problem's `README.md` will provide you with a comprehensive overview, including the problem statement, a solution explanation, and sometimes additional resources for further reading.

## My Progress

Below is a list of topics I've covered, along with links to each specific problem and solution:

- Arrays
  - [x] [Two Sum](./Array_String/TwoSum/README.md)
  - [x] [Valid Anagram](./Array_String/ValidAnagram/README.md)
  - [ ] More to come...

- Strings
  - [ ] Coming soon...

_(This section will be updated regularly as I progress.)_

## Reflections and Learning

After solving each problem, I take some time to reflect on what I've learned, the challenges I faced, and how I overcame them. These reflections are shared within the problem-specific `README.md` files. My hope is that these insights will not only solidify my understanding but also help others who may face similar challenges.

## Contributing

While this repository is primarily a personal development tool, I welcome contributions, suggestions, and discussions from the community. If you have alternative solutions, optimizations, or feedback, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/yourusername/leetcode-practice/issues) or submit a pull request.
